 FAQ SECTION

 Headline
FAQ's

 Subheadline
Get answers to common questions about our services, process, and pricing.

---

Q1: How long does it take to complete my project?

A: Timeline depends on your selected package:
- Business Starter: 14 business days
- Nonstandard Growth: 21 business days
- Premium Enterprise: 35 business days

These timelines begin once we've received all necessary materials (content, images, branding preferences) from you. We'll provide a detailed project timeline during your kickoff call. Rush delivery is available for an additional fee.

---

Q2: What if I need changes after my website launches?

A: Every package includes a support period after launch (ranging from 2 weeks to 6 months depending on your package). During this time, minor adjustments and bug fixes are included. For ongoing changes and updates, we offer affordable maintenance plans starting at $299/month, or pay-as-you-go rates at $150/hour for development work.

---

Q3: Do I own my website and all the files?

A: Absolutely! You own 100% of your website, content, designs, and all associated files. We'll provide you with complete access to your hosting, domain, and all source files. You're never locked into working with us, though we're confident you'll want to continue the relationship.

---

Q4: What platform do you build websites on?

A: We typically build on WordPress, Webflow, or custom HTML/CSS depending on your specific needs and preferences. During our discovery call, we'll recommend the best platform for your business goals, technical requirements, and budget. All our websites are mobile-responsive, fast-loading, and SEO-optimized regardless of platform.

---

Q5: Can I upgrade my package later?

A: Yes! Many of our clients start with Business Starter and upgrade as they grow. If you upgrade within 6 months, we'll credit your initial package cost toward the higher tier. You only pay the difference. We're here to grow with you.

---

Q6: Do you provide content writing, or do I need to supply all content?

A: We can do both! If you have existing content, we'll help refine and optimize it for web. If you need content created from scratch, we offer professional copywriting services starting at $200/page. This includes SEO-optimized, conversion-focused content that represents your brand perfectly.

---

Q7: What happens if I'm not satisfied with the design?

A: Your satisfaction is our priority. Each package includes multiple revision rounds. We start with a detailed discovery session to understand your vision, then provide mockups for your approval before development begins. We won't move forward until you're 100% happy with the design direction. In 500+ projects, we've never had a client walk away unsatisfied.

---

Q8: Is hosting and domain included in the price?

A: Yes! Your first year of hosting and domain registration is included in all packages. After the first year, hosting costs typically range from $15-50/month depending on your traffic and requirements. We'll set up automatic renewals or you can manage it yourself.

---

Q9: Can you integrate with tools we're already using?

A: Most likely, yes! We specialize in integrations and work with hundreds of popular business tools including Salesforce, HubSpot, Mailchimp, QuickBooks, Shopify, Zapier, and many more. During your consultation, tell us what tools you use, and we'll confirm compatibility and plan the integration.

---

Q10: Do you offer payment plans?

A: Yes! For packages over $3,000, we offer payment plans:
- 50% due at project start
- 50% due upon completion

For the Premium Enterprise package, we can arrange monthly payment terms. Contact us to discuss options that work for your budget.

---

Q11: What kind of support do you provide after launch?

A: Support levels vary by package:
- Starter: 2 weeks email support
- Growth: 3 months priority support
- Premium: 6 months 24/7 priority support with dedicated account manager

After your included support period, you can continue with one of our maintenance plans or pay-as-you-go. We also offer comprehensive training so you can manage basic updates yourself.

---

Q12: How do the AI features actually work?

A: Our AI solutions are custom-trained on your business:

AI Chatbot: Lives on your website, answers customer questions based on your FAQ, services, and content. Can book appointments, collect leads, and escalate complex issues to humans.

AI Phone Agent: Handles incoming calls, uses natural language processing to understand requests, provides information, books appointments, and transfers to your team when needed.

Both systems learn from interactions and improve over time. You maintain full control and can review all conversations.

---

Q13: What if my business needs are unique or complex?

A: Our packages cover 90% of business needs, but we love custom challenges! If your requirements don't fit neatly into our standard packages, we'll create a custom proposal tailored to your exact needs. Schedule a consultation and let's discuss your vision.

---

Q14: Do you work with businesses outside the United States?

A: While we're US-based, we work with clients globally. All consultations and communication can happen via video calls and email. We're experienced with international projects and different time zones. Note that payment is processed in USD.

---

Q15: How do I get started?

A: Simple three-step process:
1. Click "Get Started" and fill out our brief questionnaire (5 minutes)
2. Schedule your free 30-minute consultation call
3. Receive your custom proposal and timeline

If you're ready to move forward, we'll send a simple agreement and invoice. Projects typically begin within 3-5 business days of contract signing.

 ABOUT US PAGE

Hero Headline: We're Not Your Typical Digital Agency

Introduction:
Nonstandard Digital was born from frustration. Our founders spent years watching talented entrepreneurs struggle with overpriced, overcomplicated digital services. Agencies that promised the world and delivered mediocrity. Freelancers who disappeared mid-project. DIY solutions that ate up precious time better spent on the actual business.

We knew there had to be a better way.

Our Mission:
To democratize enterprise-level digital solutions, making them accessible and affordable for businesses at every stage. We believe every entrepreneur deserves professional digital infrastructure without the enterprise price tag.

Our Approach:
- Transparent: Fixed pricing, clear timelines, no surprises
- Comprehensive: Complete solutions, not piecemeal services
- Modern: Cutting-edge AI and automation technology
- Accessible: Clear communication, no confusing jargon
- Results-Driven: Your business growth is our success metric

Our Team:
We're a distributed team of 25+ designers, developers, strategists, and automation specialists located across the United States. Every project is handled by senior-level professionals with 8+ years of experience. No juniors learning on your dime.

Our Values:
1. Quality Without Compromise: Every deliverable meets our high standards
2. Partnership Over Transactions: We're invested in your long-term success
3. Innovation as Standard: We don't just keep up with technology, we lead
4. Honest Communication: We tell you what you need, not what sells
5. Empowerment: We build systems you can eventually manage yourself
